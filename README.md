## 1️⃣ Source Identification

### 📊 Data Sources & Characteristics
Our pipeline ingests customer complaints from four primary channels:

| Source | Format | Processing Type | Volume/Day | Peak Hours |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **Twitter/X** | JSON | Real-time Stream | 2,000-3,000 | 24/7 |
| **Web Forms** | JSON/Form Data | Real-time | 1,500-2,000 | 9 AM - 6 PM |
| **SMS** | Text | Hourly Batches | 1,000-1,500 | 9 AM - 8 PM |
| **Phone Logs** | CSV/XML | Daily Batches | 2,000-3,000 | 9 AM - 6 PM |

**🔸 Real-time Streaming Sources:**
- **Twitter/X**: JSON format, continuous stream via Twitter API
- **Web Forms**: JSON/form data, real-time submission capture

**🔹 Batch Processing Sources:**
- **SMS Complaints**: Text messages, processed in hourly batches
- **Phone Call Logs**: Structured CSV/XML files, daily batch processing

### 📈 Volume Assumptions
- Daily complaint volume: 5,000-10,000 across all channels
- Peak hours: 9 AM - 6 PM (business hours)
- Social media: 24/7 activity with sentiment-driven spikes

---

## 2️⃣ Ingestion Strategy

### 🔄 Mixed Ingestion Approach
The architecture employs both streaming and batch ingestion to optimize for each data source's characteristics:

```python
# Conceptual Ingestion Flow
Streaming Sources:
├── Twitter API → Real-time Stream Processing
└── Web Forms → Event-driven Capture

Batch Sources:
├── Phone Logs → Daily Scheduled Jobs
└── SMS Data → Hourly Micro-batches
```

**🚀 Streaming Ingestion:**
- Real-time capture for Twitter and web form data
- Immediate processing capability for urgent complaints
- Event-driven architecture for responsive customer service

**⏰ Batch Ingestion:**
- Scheduled processing for phone logs (daily)
- Micro-batch processing for SMS (hourly)
- Optimized for high-volume, structured data processing

---

## 3️⃣ Processing & Transformation Layer

### ⚙️ Three-Stage Processing Pipeline

```
Raw Data → [Cleaning] → [Validation] → [Enhancement] → Processed Data
```

| Stage | Purpose | Key Activities |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **🧹 Data Cleaning** | Standardization | Format normalization, duplicate removal, missing data handling |
| **✅ Metadata Validation** | Quality Assurance | Schema validation, business rule checks, anomaly flagging |
| **🎯 Data Enhancement** | Value Addition | Categorization, sentiment analysis, customer enrichment |

**🧹 Data Cleaning:**
- Standardize formats across different sources
- Remove duplicates and invalid entries
- Handle missing data with predefined business rules

**✅ Metadata Validation:**
- Ensure data quality and completeness
- Validate customer IDs and complaint timestamps
- Flag anomalies for manual review

**🎯 Data Enhancement:**
- Categorize complaints into: `Network`, `Billing`, `Customer Service`
- Apply sentiment analysis for priority scoring
- Enrich with customer profile data
- Generate unique complaint IDs for tracking

---

## 4️⃣ Storage Architecture

### 🏗️ Dual-Layer Storage Strategy

```
Data Flow:
Raw Sources → Data Lake (JSON) → Processing → Data Warehouse (Parquet)
```

| Storage Layer | Format | Purpose | Use Cases |
|--------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **🗂️ Data Lake** | JSON | Raw Data Preservation | Reprocessing, Compliance, Backup |
| **🏪 Data Warehouse** | Parquet | Analytics Optimization | BI Tools, Reports, Dashboards |

**🗂️ Data Lake (Raw Data - JSON Format):**
- ✅ Preserves original complaint data in native format
- ✅ Enables data reprocessing with updated business logic
- ✅ Supports compliance and audit requirements
- ✅ Provides backup for disaster recovery scenarios

**🏪 Data Warehouse (Structured Data - Parquet Format):**
- ⚡ Analytics-optimized columnar storage
- 📦 Compressed, high-performance query capabilities
- 📋 Schema-enforced data for consistent reporting
- 🔗 Optimized for BI tool integration

### 💡 Storage Rationale
This approach balances flexibility (raw data preservation) with performance (structured analytics), following industry best practices for telecom data management.
